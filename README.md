### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on all things IaC and/or GitOps. I've got a long term side-project to deploy resources with Terraform then use Chef Inspec to validate the resources from the CI/CD pipeline.

- :book: I’m currently studying for the GCP Professional Cloud DevOps Engineer 

- 💬 Ask me about IaC integration testing. Interested to hear how others are tacking reployed reource validation

- 📫 Reach out me on LinkedIn :grinning:

- :bulb: After a birrage of certifications my learning priorities are

| Priority      | Technology    | Notes  |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
| 1             | Terraform     |  I've only started to scratch the surface with Terraform. Would really tike to do design some more complex deployments using  dynamic blocks with expressions/conditions and tiered state. |
| 2             | DevSecOps     |  Implement terrascan, checkov and/or other code scanning tools.  |
| 3             | Testing       |   Implement terratest/Ched Inspec and/or other system testing tools. 🤓 |
| 4             | Documentation  |   Implement automatic documentation |
| 5             | Grafana       |   Design some smick dashboard. :joy: |
