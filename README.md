### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on all things IaC and/or GitOps. I've got a long term side-project to deploy resources with Terraform then use Chef Inspec to validate the resources from the CI/CD pipeline.

- :book: Iâ€™m currently studying for the AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about IaC integration testing. Interested to hear how others are tacking reployed reource validation

- ðŸ“« Reach out me on LinkedIn :grinning:

- :bulb: After a birrage of certifications my learning priorities are

| Priority      | Technology    | Notes  |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
| 1             | Terraform     | I've only started to scratch the surface with Terraform. Would really tike to do find/design some more complex deployments using  counts and conditions |
| 2             | Grafana       |   Design some smick dashboard. :joy: |
| 3             | Chaos Engineering |    I think this is an interesting topic and provided more oppertunity for pipeline driven workflows. |
