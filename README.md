### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on all things Infastructure as Code. I recently passed the AI-102 (Designing and Implementing a Microsoft Azure AI Solutions) Exam and I'm writing a 8 part blog about implementing MLOps on Azure. https://arinco.com.au/?s=roberts&id=1951&post_type=post

- :book: I’m currently studying studing for the Certified Kubernetes Associate (CKA) Exam. My goal is to complete pass the exam by years end. 🤞

- 💬 Ask me about Azure IaC and integration testing. Interested to hear how others are tackling resource validation post deployment.

- 📫 Reach out me on LinkedIn 😁

- ⚡ Fun fact: I started my career as L1 Support for a small MSP

- :bulb: Although my primary focus is certification and writing Azure blogs, my areas of interest/learning for future blogs are:

| Priority      | Technology    | Notes  |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----:|
| 1             | Terraform     | I've only started to scratch the surface with Terraform. Would really tike to do design some more complex deployments, especially enterprise deployments using Terraform CAF/Landing Zones |
| 2             | DevSecOps     | Implement terrascan, checkov, Skyk and/or other IaC code scanning tools.  |
| 3             | Testing       | Implement terratest/Chef Inspec and/or other system testing tools. 🤓 |
| 4             | Documentation | Implement automated documentation using LLM's |
| 5             | Kubernetes    | I hit Mount Stupid of the Dunning-Kruger curve after working/studying K8s for a short period and realised I know nothing 😂 I plan to correct that and work on Helm some more 🚀 |
| 6             | Python       | Develop more applications using the Azure Python SDK's. 🐍 |
| 7             | Platform Engineering | Extremely keen to get hands on and build an IDP using Backstage |
